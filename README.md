# emailchecker
<h3>Check if an email address is valid</h3>

You can try the demo here: https://tanito.me/tools/email-checker/
<br>
It is very simple, so you can modify it.
<br>
<p>It is necessary to have PHP Composer installed, otherwise the checker will not work.</p>

```bash
sudo curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```
